The Engineer emphasized practical feasibility and technical constraints, highlighting implementation challenges and resource requirements.

The Visionary pushed for innovative approaches and transformative thinking, encouraging the group to consider revolutionary possibilities.

The Ethicist ensured moral implications and societal impacts were thoroughly examined, advocating for fairness and accountability.

This multi-perspective analysis demonstrates the value of diverse viewpoints in addressing complex questions. Each agent's unique lens contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.`;
